APIs...

Like menus from a restaurant. We look at the menu and ask for an item, the API then sends us what we requested
if we have permission.

Think back to my python course... Here I simply got a URL that was linked to a specific server and sent me a 
relevant response.

Often the data is sent to us in JSON format - JavaScript Object Notation.
